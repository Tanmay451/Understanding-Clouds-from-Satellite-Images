# Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images


In this challenge, we will build a model to classify cloud organization patterns from satellite images. If successful, weâ€™ll help scientists to better understand how clouds will shape our future climate. This research will guide the development of next-generation models which could reduce uncertainties in climate projections.
